## 📦 BUILD #1: WATCHDOG SYSTEM (00:21-00:38)

### Purpose
Monitor actual work output vs just messaging. Send transparency reports to Dany every 30 minutes showing what files were modified and productivity score.

### Problem Solved
I was saying "working" but not actually building anything (standby mode). Dany needed a watchdog to catch this and report real activity.

### Files Created

#### 1. `/skills/watchdog/activity-tracker.js` (6.7KB, 250 lines)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/activity-tracker.js`

**What it does:**
- Scans workspace for all modified files since last check
- Categorizes files by type:
  - Code files (.js, .py, .sh): 10 points each
  - Documentation (.md): 5 points each
  - Data files (.json, .csv): 3 points each
  - Git commits: 15 points each
- Calculates productivity score (0-100)
- Generates formatted report for Telegram

**Scoring system:**
```
0 points: ⚠️ NO WORK - Idle or just messaging
1-19: 📝 Minimal activity
20-49: ✅ Good progress
50+: 🔥 High productivity
```

**Key functions:**
- `findModifiedFiles(sinceTimestamp)` - Git-based file discovery
- `categorizeFile(filepath)` - Determines file type and point value
- `calculateProductivity(files, commits)` - Scores 0-100
- `generateReport(files, commits, score, duration)` - Formats output

**State tracking:**
Uses `/skills/watchdog/watchdog-state.json` to remember last check time.

#### 2. `/skills/watchdog/watchdog-control.js` (1.1KB, 40 lines)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/watchdog-control.js`

**What it does:**
Pause/play/status control for watchdog via simple CLI.

**Commands:**
```bash
node watchdog-control.js pause   # Stop reports
node watchdog-control.js play    # Resume reports
node watchdog-control.js status  # Check if active
```

**How it works:**
File-based control using `/skills/watchdog/.paused` marker file.
- Exists = paused
- Doesn't exist = active

#### 3. `/skills/watchdog/run-and-send.js` (1.5KB, 50 lines)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/run-and-send.js`

**What it does:**
Integration wrapper that runs tracker and sends report to Telegram.

**Flow:**
1. Check if paused (skip if paused)
2. Run activity tracker
3. Send report via OpenClaw message API
4. Update state file with current timestamp

**Environment:**
Expects `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in environment (Dany's chat: 6044518079)

#### 4. `/skills/watchdog/send-report.sh` (631 bytes)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/send-report.sh`

**What it does:**
Bash wrapper for cron jobs.

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x send-report.sh
./send-report.sh
```

Sets up Node.js environment and runs `run-and-send.js`.

#### 5. `/skills/watchdog/SKILL.md` (3KB)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/SKILL.md`

**What it does:**
Complete documentation for the watchdog system.

**Contents:**
- System overview
- How scoring works
- How to set up cron
- How to pause/resume
- File structure
- Testing instructions

### How to Use

**Test manually:**
```bash
cd /home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog
node activity-tracker.js
```

**Run full integration:**
```bash
node run-and-send.js
```

**Set up cron (30-minute intervals):**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add this line:
*/30 * * * * /home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/watchdog/send-report.sh
```

**Pause/resume:**
```bash
node watchdog-control.js pause   # Stop sending reports
node watchdog-control.js play    # Resume
node watchdog-control.js status  # Check state
```

### Test Results
- First run: Found 1610 files (state file had old timestamp - fixed)
- Second run: Found 2 files in last 1 min (correct)
- Productivity: 5/100 (minimal - just docs)
- Report sent to Telegram successfully

### Current State
✅ **WORKING** - All components tested and functional
⏸️ **NOT SCHEDULED** - Cron job not yet configured (waiting for Dany's approval)

### Next Steps
- Set up cron job for automated 30-minute checks
- OR keep manual/on-demand only

## 📦 BUILD #2: OPPORTUNITY MATCHER AGENT (00:39-00:52)

### Purpose
4th and final agent for Business Engine. Assesses whether WE can execute a business opportunity based on our skills, competitive advantage, and available resources.

### File Created

#### `/skills/business-engine/agents/opportunity-matcher.js` (15.3KB, 470+ lines)
**Location:** `/home/kaff/.openclaw/workspace/skills/business-engine/agents/opportunity-matcher.js`

**What it does:**
Analyzes execution feasibility for business opportunities through 3 lenses:

**1. Skills Matching**
- Maintains inventory of available skills:
  - Technical: Node.js, Python, AI/ML, APIs, databases, automation, web dev
  - Business: Market research, sales, marketing, product management
  - Domain: E-commerce, automation, AI agents, SaaS, trading systems
- Compares required skills vs available skills
- Calculates match score (0-1)
- Identifies critical skill gaps

**2. Competitive Advantage Assessment**
- Analyzes 4 moat types:
  - **Technical moats:** Proprietary tech, AI models, algorithms
  - **Market moats:** Network effects, brand, customer lock-in
  - **Operational moats:** Cost structure, speed, quality
  - **Resource moats:** Data, partnerships, capital
- Compares vs competitors from knowledge base
- Calculates advantage score (0-1)

**3. Execution Feasibility**
- Checks resource availability:
  - Time (hours available per week)
  - Money (budget for tools/services)
  - Skills (team capabilities)
  - Infrastructure (servers, APIs, tools we already have)
- Estimates build timeline
- Identifies blockers and dependencies
- Returns feasibility score (0-1)

**Key functions:**
- `analyzeSkills(description, opportunity)` - Skills gap analysis
- `assessCompetitiveAdvantage(description, competitors)` - Moat analysis
- `calculateFeasibility(description, resources)` - Execution analysis
- `synthesizeAnalysis(skillsAnalysis, advantageAnalysis, feasibilityAnalysis)` - Combines all findings

**Agent Interface:**
```javascript
{
  agentId: "opportunity-matcher",
  role: "skills-matching",
  capabilities: [
    "match-skills",
    "assess-advantage", 
    "calculate-feasibility"
  ]
}
```

**Output format:**
```javascript
{
  confidence: 0.73,
  recommendation: "PROCEED",
  reasoning: "High skills match (85%), clear competitive advantage...",
  analysis: {
    skills_match: 0.85,
    skill_gaps: ["CRM API integration"],
    competitive_advantage: 0.75,
    key_advantages: ["German market focus", "GDPR-first"],
    feasibility: 0.80,
    timeline_estimate: "4-6 weeks",
    blockers: []
  }
}
```

### Integration with Business Engine

**Updated files:**
- `/skills/business-engine/orchestration/orchestrator.js` - Registered opportunity-matcher agent
- `/skills/business-engine/test-engine.js` - Added 4-agent validation test

**Agent collaboration:**
Opportunity Matcher can be called by other agents:
- Market Intelligence finds opportunity → delegates to Opportunity Matcher to check if we can execute
- Risk Analyst assesses execution risk → uses Opportunity Matcher to validate feasibility

### Test Results

**Test input:** "AI-powered lead qualification service for B2B sales teams"

**Opportunity Matcher output:**
- Skills match: 85% (have Node.js, AI/ML, APIs; need CRM integration)
- Competitive advantage: 75% (German market focus, GDPR-first design)
- Feasibility: 80% (can build in 4-6 weeks)
- **Confidence:** 73%
- **Recommendation:** PROCEED

**Full 4-agent system test:**
- Market Intelligence: PROCEED (70%)
- Revenue Guardian: PROCEED (75%)
- Risk Analyst: PROCEED (72%)
- Opportunity Matcher: PROCEED (73%)
- **Final synthesis:** 73% confidence, 4 positive signals → "YES - Proceed with build"

### Current State
✅ **COMPLETE** - Fully integrated and tested
✅ **BUSINESS ENGINE 100%** - All 4/4 agents operational
