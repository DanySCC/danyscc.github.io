### 🎯 COMBINATION 4: "COLLECTIONS + SALES CRM" ★★★☆☆
**Combine: #2 (Collections) + #4 (Sales CRM)**

**Rationale:**
Both are B2B sales cycle tools - win the deal, then collect payment

**Common Patterns:**
- B2B customer lifecycle
- Communication automation
- CRM integration
- Payment tracking
- Customer relationship management

**Unified Value Prop:**
*"Win more deals faster, then collect payment faster - full B2B revenue cycle automation"*

**Why This Works:**
1. **Sequential workflow** - Win deal → deliver → invoice → collect
2. **Same customer data** - CRM contacts flow to invoicing
3. **Shared integrations** - CRM + accounting systems
4. **Sales team overlap** - Account management owns both relationships

**Technical Synergies:**
- CRM integrations (contacts flow to invoices)
- Communication automation (email/SMS)
- Customer data unification
- Revenue analytics

**Go-to-Market Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **Different pain points** - Sales velocity vs. cash flow
- ⚠️ **Sometimes different buyers** - Sales leader vs. CFO
- ⚠️ **Timing mismatch** - New customer vs. existing customer focus

**Market Fit:**
- B2B SaaS companies
- Professional services
- Agencies
- Consultants

⭐ **COMBINATION SCORE: 7.0/10** - Logical pairing but not as compelling as Revenue Recovery Suite
