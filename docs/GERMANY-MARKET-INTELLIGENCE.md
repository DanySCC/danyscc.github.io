**Addressable market:** ~500,000 micro-businesses in Germany

**Current state:** Most tools require developers, training, technical staff  
**Opportunity:** No-code automation with zero training (grandmother-test)  
**Target segments:** Craft businesses, traditional retail, services  
**Competitive intensity:** Medium - Levity AI, BRYTER exist but complex

### 4. Industry-Specific Vertical Automation
**Current state:** Generic tools require too much customization  
**Opportunity:** Pre-built workflows for manufacturing, healthcare, legal  
**Competitive advantage:** Out-of-the-box solutions for specific industries  
**Pricing potential:** Premium (€199-499/month for vertical solutions)

### 5. SAP Integration Layer for SMEs
**Current state:** Mid-size SAP users can't afford custom integrations (€50k-200k)

**Opportunity:** Built for German language, culture, business practices  
**Proof point:** DeepL proved German AI leadership possible
