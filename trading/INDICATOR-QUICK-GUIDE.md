# ⚡ QUICK GUIDE: 5 INDICATORS TO ADD NOW

**Based on deep research + institutional standards**

---

## 🔥 **THE ESSENTIAL 5**

### **1. VWAP** (Volume Weighted Average Price)
**Add to:** Main price chart (overlay)  
**Settings:** Standard session VWAP  
**Why:** Institutional standard. 671% return in academic study. Dynamic support/resistance.  
**How:** Price above VWAP = bullish, below = bearish. Bounce off VWAP = trade opportunity.

---

### **2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**
**Add to:** Lower panel (oscillator)  
**Settings:** 21 period  
**Why:** Shows accumulation (buying pressure) vs distribution (selling pressure). Volume confirmation.  
**How:** CMF > 0 = bullish, CMF < 0 = bearish. Divergence = reversal signal.

---

### **3. Volume Profile** (Fixed Range)
**Add to:** Main price chart (right side histogram)  
**Settings:** Session-based or fixed range  
**Why:** Shows WHERE volume traded. Better than S/R lines.  
**How:** POC (Point of Control) = strongest S/R. Low Volume Nodes = gaps to fill.

---

### **4. Bollinger Bands**
**Add to:** Main price chart (overlay)  
**Settings:** 20 period, 2 standard deviations  
**Why:** Volatility + mean reversion. Visual confirmation of your Squeeze Momentum.  
**How:** Tight bands = squeeze (breakout coming). Price at upper/lower band = overbought/oversold.

---

### **5. DXY Correlation Overlay**
**Add to:** Split screen or indicator overlay  
**Settings:** Invert DXY scale  
**Why:** Crypto moves INVERSE to Dollar. Strong dollar = weak BTC.  
**How:** DXY falling = BTC bullish. DXY rising = BTC bearish.

## 📊 **BONUS: DAILY CHECKS** (Not on chart)

- **Fear & Greed Index:** https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/  
  - Current: **9 (Extreme Fear)** ← Potential buy zone!
- **Funding Rates:** https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/funding-rates/

---

## 🧹 **CONSIDER REMOVING:**

1. **CM_Ultimate_MA_MTF_V2** — You have MA 50/200 already (redundant)
2. **Three Step Future Trend** — Predictive indicators are unreliable
3. **Elite Algo Modded** — Black box (unknown methodology)

**Why remove?** Less is more. 3-5 indicators max = clarity.
