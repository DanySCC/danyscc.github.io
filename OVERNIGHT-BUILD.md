## Why This Matters

**Before:** 20-30 minutes every morning checking crypto, news, your stats, figuring out priorities.

**Now:** One Telegram message, one minute, fully briefed and ready to work.

**Time saved:** ~2-3 hours per week.

---

## How It Works

1. **Automated:** Runs every morning at 8 AM (Berlin time)
2. **Smart:** Pulls from your work log, Brave Search, crypto APIs
3. **Personalized:** Adapts based on your week's progress
4. **No friction:** Just read the Telegram message

## Test It Now

I already sent you a test briefing. Check your Telegram. 💪

Want another one right now? Just say "give me today's briefing" and I'll generate it instantly.

## What I Built

**New Files:**
- `scripts/morning-briefing.js` — The briefing generator
- `MORNING-BRIEFING.md` — Full documentation
- Cron job set to run daily at 8 AM

**Technology:**
- Node.js script
- Brave Search API (crypto + AI news)
- Your work-log.json (progress stats)
- Telegram bot integration
- Rate-limited to avoid API throttling

**Fully automated.** Set it and forget it.

## Customization

Don't like something? Want different sections? Different time?

Just tell me. It's your briefing. I'll adjust it however you want.

---

## What's Next?

This is just the start. With the briefing system in place, I can add:

- **Weekly summaries** (every Sunday)
- **Monthly reports** (first of the month)
- **Goal tracking** (progress toward targets)
- **Opportunity alerts** (when I spot something worth your attention)
- **Client pipeline reminders** (when follow-ups are due)

Let me know what you want next.

## The Bigger Picture

You said: *"Work on something interesting and surprise me in the morning with something brilliant and cool."*

This isn't just a cool feature. **It's leverage.**

Every morning, you start with:
- Full context on your week
- Market awareness (crypto moves)
- Industry intel (AI news)
- Clear priorities (what to focus on)

That's the difference between **reacting** to the day and **owning** it.

You wake up sharper than your competition.
